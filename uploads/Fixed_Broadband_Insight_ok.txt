1. Subscriber Metrics: The active users count stands at 7,544,039, with a ratio to CB (possibly meaning combination of both services) at 84%. The Customer Base (CB) is larger at 8,976,625 users, which suggests that not all of the customer base is currently active on the fixed broadband service. 

2. Financial Performance Indicators: The average ARPU (Average Revenue Per User) is split into two categories: All (237,244) and RGB (282,296), with both values given in a currency not specified in the image. This information helps in understanding the average revenue generated per user for the service. 

3. Sales and Churn Rates: The dashboard reflects that there have been 91,819 sales MTD (Month-to-Date), with an average of 4,833 daily sales. However, there is also a churn (customers leaving) amounting to 12,865 MTD, which implies that customer retention is an issue that needs attention.

1. Conversion rates have decreased: The 'Conversion rates' section of the dashboard shows a noticeable decrease in both 'Won revenue %' and 'Opportunity conversion'. The 'Won revenue %' has decreased by 5.7% between the periods being compared (APL - Actual Previous Length of period and AFC - Actual Full Cycle), and 'Opportunity conversion' declined by 6%. This may indicate that the sales team has been less effective in turning prospects into actual sales and moving opportunities through the funnel to closure during this period.

2. The company has a few key customers driving significant revenue: In the 'Top 15 customers by Won revenue' table, we can observe that a small number of customers are responsible for a large portion of the won revenue. This means the company may rely heavily on these top customers for its sales and might need to consider diversifying its customer base to mitigate risks.
